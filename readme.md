# Restoration_Topology_Graph
> Research framework. Our research consisted 5 parts: 1) extracting urban features related to psychology restoration, including socioeconomic, perceptional, and spatial features; 2) constructing a city-level graph by aggregating urban features into road units as nodes and road topology as edges; 3) labeling nodes by using the PRS-11questionnaire to score and label each road unit; 4) training the model and making prediction by treating the city-level graph as input to predict urban restoration quality through GNNs-based models; and 5) conducting an overall analysis, which including evaluating model performance, examining spatial distribution, and spatial structure of restoration quality.

> Highlight: Embedding the spatial structure. First, a spatial graph of entities was constructed by inferring the adjacency relationships between pixels of the entities. Second, cross-graph links were established by calculating the cosine similarity between corresponding entities (i.e., same category) in two graphs. ResNet-18 was employed for entity embedding. Finally, treating roads as the smallest units, GCN was utilized to transform the street structure into vectors.
