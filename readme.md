# Restoration_Topology_Graph
Research framework. Our research is divided into 5 parts: 1). Feature extraction, this part extracts three levels of urban features: socioeconomic, perceptional, and spatial; 2). Graph construction, this part focuses on aggregating urban features and constructing a city-level graph through road topology; 3). Data labeling, this part involves using the PRS-11 questionnaire to score and label data; 4). Model training and prediction, this part treats the city-level graph as input to predict urban restoration quality through GNN-based models; 5). Overall analysis and results, there are four results represented.
